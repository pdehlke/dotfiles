# Catch Up — Restore Session Context

You are restoring context after a session start, `/clear`, or context compaction. Gather everything the developer needs to resume work without asking questions. Be fast, be comprehensive, report concisely.

## 1. Orientation

Always run these regardless of branch:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log --oneline -10
```

This gives: current branch, uncommitted changes, and recent history.

## 2. Open PRs

Detect what's available and use it:

**On a feature branch:**
```bash
gh pr list --state open --head "$(git branch --show-current)" \
  --json number,title,url,statusCheckRollup --limit 1 2>/dev/null
```

**On main/master/develop:**
```bash
gh pr list --state open --limit 5 \
  --json number,title,headRefName 2>/dev/null
```

If `gh` is unavailable, skip and note "PR status unavailable (no `gh` CLI)."

## 3. Issue Tracker Context

Detect which tracker this project uses and pull current state:

**Linear:** If the Linear MCP is connected and the project references Linear (check CLAUDE.md, README, or `.claude/` configs), pull the active sprint/cycle and any issues assigned to the current user or linked to the current branch.

**GitHub Issues:** If no Linear, use `gh` to check for issues linked to the current branch or recent PRs.

**Neither:** Skip. Don't fail the catchup over missing tracker access.

## 4. Changed Files

**On a feature branch** (not main/master/develop):
```bash
git diff --name-only main...HEAD 2>/dev/null || git diff --name-only master...HEAD 2>/dev/null
```

Read key changed files to understand work-in-progress context. For large diffs (20+ files), read only the most recently modified files rather than all of them.

**On the default branch:** Skip. Recent context comes from git log.

## 5. Progress File

Look for a project progress or session state file:
```bash
ls claude-progress.md PROGRESS.md .claude-progress progress.md AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null
```

If one exists, read it. These files carry forward decisions, blockers, and next steps across sessions.

## 6. Project Slash Commands

```bash
ls .claude/commands/ .claude/skills/ 2>/dev/null
```

If project-specific commands exist, mention them briefly so the developer knows what's available in this project.

## 7. Summarize

Report concisely in this structure:

- **Branch:** current branch name and commit
- **Uncommitted changes:** list or "clean"
- **Open PR:** number, title, CI status — or "none"
- **What's been done:** synthesized from recent commits, PR descriptions, progress file
- **Current state:** what the code looks like right now (green CI? failing tests? mid-refactor?)
- **Next steps:** inferred from progress file, open issues, or branch name
- **Blockers:** from progress file or issue tracker, if any
- **Available commands:** project-specific slash commands, if any

Do not ask follow-up questions. The developer invoked `/catchup` because they want context delivered, not a conversation.
